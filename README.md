# AVCamera-Test
First try with AVFoundation Framework.


 The aim of this app is to implement a fully working Camera App using AVFoundation API. 
 I'm using Swift 3 lang and the latest iOS 10 sdk.
 
 When the basic UI and functions (take and save photos) are done, I'll try to add manual controls too.
 It would be nice to add also raw capture (for ios 10).
